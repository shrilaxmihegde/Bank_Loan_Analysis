# Bank Loan Analysis

## Overview of the project:

Here we are discussing  Loan application analysis to monitor bank-leading activities and performance. Here we can see all bank loan reports. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

## KPI
  ### DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY 

1. ##### Total Loan Application: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications during the specified period. Additionally, it's essential to monitor Month-to date and loan application track changes Month over month (MOM) 

2. ##### Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as a loan is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD total funded amount and analyze the month-over-month(MOM) changes in this metric.

3. ##### Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrows is essential for assessing the bank cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyze the Month to Date and the total amount received and observe the month over month.

4. ##### Avg Interest Rate: Calculating the Average interest rate across all the loans, Month to Dtae and Month over Month variations in interest rates will provide insights into our leading portfolio's overall cost.

5. ##### Average Date to Income Ratio(DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
 

### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s

In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.
 
### Good Loan KPIs :
1. #### Good Loan Application Percentage: We need to calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans.' This category includes loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

2. #### Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category, which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

3. #### Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans.' This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

4. #### Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' which encompasses all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

### Bad Loan KPIs:
1. #### Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans.' This category specifically includes loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

2. #### Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

3. #### Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans.' This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

4. #### Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' which includes all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

### DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW

In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. Below are the specific chart requirements:

1. ####  Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):
 
2. #### Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):
 
3. #### Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):

4. #### Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):

5. #### Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):

6. #### Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):
   

### DASHBOARD 3: DETAILS

In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.


## Objective:
The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
